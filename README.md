# CFG-Team-2

This is the code for our team project created as a part of the Code First Girls Web Development course.
We  collectively choose to produce a website supporting women getting into tech with events, social media, jobs and much more.

We built a mobile first web-site that changes its layout based on the browser dimensions.

## What was our process?

We used Figma to produce a wireframe mock up of the design of the website.

We then produced a base html and css file with the basic outline of the website including font and colours. 

Each person in the team then did one area of the website themselves and added their code into master via a branch. 


## What is the course about?

Code first girls run free coding for women in the UK aiming to reduce the gender diversity gap in the tech industry. They've taught *80,000* women to code so far!

This was an 8 week course that taught all of the fundamentals of web design and development. We completed individual learning and exercises throughout the weeks and a final team project - this is ours!



## What did we learn?

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Collaboration with Github
